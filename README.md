## git-praise

For when stuff needs praising.

This creates a new git alias that aliases `git blame` to `git praise`.

Installation can easily be done by running

```
curl -sSL http://ev1l0rd.info/git-praise/praise.sh | bash
```
In your command line.

If you don't trust running scripts from the web, check the github repo at [ev1l0rd/git-praise](https://github.com/ev1l0rd/git-praise) and download and review it before running it. Hindsight is 20/20 and nobody wants to be on the receiving end of it.
